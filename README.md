## Fun facts

- My first contact with programming was in 2015, at the beginning of my high school, where I had the opportunity to meet someone who opened my eyes to this world, [Kao Ming](https://www.escavador.com/sobre/3561806/kao-yung-ming), my teacher and professor of programming logic, who helped me to enter this world.

- During my high school years, together with my group, we developed a project focused on Mental Health, Project Somos, which aimed to connect Mental Health professionals with people who need help and cannot afford therapy. The project impacted many people, and feeling that our project contributed to people's lives was enough for me to fall in love with this area.

- My start in the job market was not easy. I participated in several selection processes, few with success, and those I could pass were canceled because I had not turned 18 yet. However, in 2019 I received my first YES to work as a FullStack Developer at Wiplay, working with Vue and Laravel.

- Today I work at Minu.co as a FullStack Developer, with NextJs and Node stacks, working on architecture initiatives and new solutions.

- As for hobbies, I practice Jiu Jitsu and in my free time, I enjoy playing a good game of CS:GO and Age of Empires.
