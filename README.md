## Fun facts  

- My first contact with programming was back in 2015, at the beginning of high school, thanks to my teacher [Kao Ming](https://www.escavador.com/sobre/3561806/kao-yung-ming), who introduced me to programming logic and inspired me to follow this path.  
- During high school, I co-created **Project Somos**, focused on mental health, connecting professionals with people who couldnâ€™t afford therapy. The impact it generated made me fall in love with technologyâ€™s power to change lives.  
- Entering the job market was not easy â€” I faced many rejections and some opportunities were canceled because I was under 18. But in 2019, I finally received my first **YES** to work as a Full Stack Developer.  
- Today, after more than 7 years of experience, I work with **React, Node, and scalable architectures**, constantly improving systems and helping businesses deliver better solutions.  
- Outside of coding, I practice **Jiu Jitsu ðŸ¥‹** and enjoy engaging with the dev community.
